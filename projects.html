    <hr class="projecthrlines">
    <p class="landscaperp">I built the Simon game by combining JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In the HTML, I structured the game's user interface, creating the game board and layout with div elements. JavaScript was essential for implementing interactivity, adding event listeners for player interactions, managing game state, and dynamically updating the DOM to reflect game progress. CSS played a vital role in styling and visual enhancements, defining the game's appearance, positioning, and animations, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface. This project demonstrates my proficiency in web development, showcasing how these three technologies collaborate to create an engaging and visually appealing Simon game.</p>

    <h2 class="titles">Landcaper Game</h2>
    <hr class="projecthrlines">
    <p class="landscaperp">I developed an incremental clicker game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where players start with a basic income source and strategically invest their earnings in tools and resources to generate higher income. Through interactive UI elements and event listeners, players accumulate money by clicking, purchase upgrades, and achieve milestones. The game incorporates feedback alerts to notify players of their progress and milestone achievements, with the ultimate goal of reaching a predefined monetary target to complete the game. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end development, user interface design, game mechanics, and the use of functions to structure code effectively for an engaging and interactive gameplay experience.</p>
