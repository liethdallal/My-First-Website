    <ul class="work">
        <li>Lobby Guide and Escort <br> AMITA Health - Hinsdale, IL <br> July 2018 to February 2020</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="workinfo">
        As a Lobby Guide and Escort, your job is to know each department of the hospital and be able to carry out tasks given to you by medical professionals. Because volunteers come and go I was asked to help train any incoming volunteers on how to handle different situations. And having this type of a leadership opportunity was a great experience. Some tasks included the transportation of patient blood samples to designated labs and the discharging of patients out of the hospital. I have had many experiences that I will never forget from this position. There were many instances of pressure when my skills were really tested. The most valuable lesson I have learned while working here is that you do not know what people are going through. I learned that regardless of how you are being treated by patients you have to understand things from their perspective and not let things let you. Overall, this position helped me grow as a person since it was one of my first-ever working environments. It was a great way to gain some insight into how a hospital is run.

    <ul class="work">
    <li>Customer Service Associate <br> Walgreens - Hinsdale, IL <br> April 2021 to August 2021</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="workinfo">
        My position as a customer service associate at Walgreens covered the store's main components: the photo department, front-end cash registers, and the restocking and supplying of shelves. The photo department is a component of the store that prioritizes the completion of orders consisting of but not limited to pictures and documents. The photo department also consists of the capturing and printing of passport photos and maintaining the storage of Fed Ex drop-offs and deliveries made by customers. Overall this position required a lot of technical knowledge since there are many possibilities of service through this department. The front-end register is another department of the store that relies on the efficiency of ringing up customers and providing the best customer service while doing so. Part of this department is the explanation of the My Walgreens reward system and how they are linked to sales in the store. The best lesson I have learned while covering this position is handling uneasy customers properly. The department of restocking and supplying shelves in the store is composed of facing and pulling products from the stock room onto the sales floor. A really important task includes looking at the expirations of all products before stocking new products. This department is very focus-oriented to prevent any type of sickness in customers and enhances the skill of attention to detail. It also requires you to work as a team. When one of us is needs help we all need to make an effort to be there for each other. Overall this position was a very good insight into how a store is run and functions through working together as a team to ensure the safety and satisfaction of customers.

    <ul class="work">
        <li>Food Demonstrator <br> CDS (Club Demonstration Services) - Lobard, IL <br> November 2021 to April 2022</be></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="workinfo">
        As a food demonstrator, my primary job was to provide live demos of specific products, while answering any customer questions. These particular products can range from food samples to cleaning samples and even some medicine-related samples. My primary goal in this position is to demonstrate these products to customers that may be interested while providing them with all the facts and addressing any concerns before they decide to try a sample. One thing that you need to be careful of in food demonstrations is to understand who is able to try your product, meaning you need to put up signs of any allergies and age restrictions if applicable. The biggest thing I took from this position was better communication skills. This entire position heavily relies on communicating accordingly while engaging in conversation. It is something I feel I have expanded upon in this position a lot as my job requires constant communication.
