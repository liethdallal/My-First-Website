    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p class="skillsdescription">
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a fundamental coding language that I have become proficient in. It serves as the backbone of web development, enabling the creation and structuring of web pages. Through hands-on experience through the software engineering bootcamp, I have learned to use HTML to organize content, define headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. This knowledge allows me to craft user-friendly and visually appealing web layouts. HTML's simplicity and versatility have enabled me to grasp its concepts effectively, and I continue to refine my skills to create seamless online experiences.

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p class="skillsdescription">
        My proficiency in CSS has been developed through self-directed learning and hands-on practice through the software engineering bootcamp. In my pursuit of web development, I embarked on a journey of exploration, utilizing online resources and practical experimentation to grasp the concepts of Cascading Style Sheets. This self-taught approach has enabled me to skillfully apply CSS properties and selectors to control the layout, design, and visual aspects of web pages. Through continuous learning and practical application, I've honed my ability to create visually appealing and responsive designs that enhance the user experience.
